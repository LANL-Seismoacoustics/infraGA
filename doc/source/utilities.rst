Utility Functions
=====================================

In addition to the various analysis and visualization capabilities of InfraPy, several utility functions are also included for a variety of tasks.  These include estimating arrival times for source, using fk analysis results to compute the best beam waveform and spectrum, computing the celerity for a signal from a known source, and writing waveform data from an FDSN or database source to local files.  Information on the various utility functions can be summarized using, :code:`infrapy utils --help`, which will print to screen the utility usage information:
