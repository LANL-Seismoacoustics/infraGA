InfraGA/GeoAc started as part of graduate work by Dr. Philip Blom during his tenure at the University of Mississippi, National Center for Physical Acocustics (NCPA) in 2007 - 2013.  More accessible methods were implemented when Dr. Blom began working at Los Alamos National Laboratory (2013 - present) and the software was licensed as open source in 2014 and continues to be expanded and improved.
